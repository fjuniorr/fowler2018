In programming, we store values in variables. Making a copy means that you initiate a new variable with the same value(s). However, there is a big potential pitfall to consider: deep copying vs. shallow copying. A deep copy means that all of the values of the new variable are copied and disconnected from the original variable. A shallow copy means that certain (sub-)values are still connected to the original variable.

```{node}
let obj = {name: {
                firstName: 'Francisco',
                lastName: 'Alves'}, 
           age: 29};


shallowCopy = Object.assign({}, obj);
shallowCopy.age = 31;
console.log(obj.age); // prints 29 because in the first level a deep copy is performed

shallowCopy.name.firstName = 'Samira';

console.log(obj.name.firstName); // prints Samira because in sublevels a shallow copy is performed
```
